In a small village surrounded by fields and hills, there lived a boy named Arun. The village was quiet, with narrow paths, mud houses, and a single banyan tree at its center. Every morning, the sound of birds and temple bells filled the air. 
Arun loved this village because it felt alive, even in silence.
